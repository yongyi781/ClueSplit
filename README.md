# clue-split
Automatically tracks your clue times while doing a clue run, with no input required!

## Installation
The easiest way to install is by copy-pasting `alt1://addapp/https://yongyi781.github.io/clue-split/appconfig.json` into your browser.

You may also open this link in the Alt1 browser (not a regular browser!): <https://yongyi781.github.io/clue-split/>

## Requirements and recommendations

1. Timestamps on in chat - it's how the app tracks clue times.
2. Interface transparency off, for best chatbox reading accuracy.
3. 12 point font size in chat, because alt1 is known to misread messages more often on other font sizes.
